          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I have always been passionate about creativity and problem solving. With a stroke of luck, I discovered my love for coding during the Covid-19 pandemic.
          </p>
          <p>
            After doing some JavaScript exercises on The Odin Project, I just wanted to keep going. At that moment, I started dreaming of doing it professionally. Over the course of the next few months, I left my previous career, finished the Full Stack JavaScript path on The Odin Project, got some certifications, worked on some personal projects, joined a boot camp, worked on more personal projects, applied to (and got rejected from) countless job opportunities before finally landing my first role as a software developer in June of 2022.
          </p>
          <p>
            I currently work at Scholarships.com where I create and implement new designs,  optimize user flows, improve site performance, refactor business logic, and conduct end-to-end testing. I also design, implement, and test email campaigns.
          </p>
          <p>
            Previously, at United Healthcare, I developed and made enhancements to multiple blue chip features with high business impact and visibility. I also improved site reliability, performance, and accessibility.
          </p>
          <p>
            Earlier, I worked as a manufacturing engineer at OSG making cutting tools for the aerospace, defense, and automotive industries. I received multiple promotions and formal recognition as a result of my commitment, accountability, and persistence to continuously improve myself, the products, the processes, and the people around me.

      <h2>Tools & Technologies</h2>
      <p>
        I consider myself technology-agnostic. My ability to delivery quality results is not bound to a specific framework as I place greater emphasis on gaining thorough understanding of the requirements. Having said that, below are some languages, frameworks, and tools I have used most recently. I want to work in technologies not listed here.
