## Hi there, I am kru ðŸ‘‹

I am a _Creative Problem Solver_.

I am currently working on modernizing the company website by creating and implementing innovative UI/UX designs, optimizing user flows, and conducting end-to-end testing as a _Web Developer_ at [Scholarships.com](https://www.scholarships.com).

My previous problem solving experiences include:
- optimizing performance, improving reliability, resolving crucial pain points, and improving brand perception as a _Frontend Developer_ at [United Healthcare](https://www.uhc.com/)
- designing, CNC programming, and machining innovative (cutting edge!) cutting tools (like [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i2iLkuTdCjX-TUlJUGK4dxf5vZBymDFM/view?usp=sharing) and [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tUnMRt3kOjj_ZFRxYazZbVh13mQLnJ4G/view?usp=sharing)) for the aerospace industry as a _Manufacturing Engineer_ at [OSG](https://www.osgtool.com/)

I have also worked on some personal projects for learning/discovery/fun like:
- [Jot](https://lil-white-shadow.github.io/jot-scheduling-app/), a full stack scheduling app made with React, Node / Express, and MongoDB used by real people every week.
- [FoodGenie](https://lil-white-shadow.github.io/food-genie/), a food search engine made with React and powered by FoodData Central API from U.S. Department of Agriculture.
- [etch-a-sketch](https://lil-white-shadow.github.io/etch-a-sketch/), A simple game made in the ancient times (2021) when learning the fundamentals of frontend development via [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).
